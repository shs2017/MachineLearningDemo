Below each section is a demonstration of individual cases of each.\r\n\r\n### Logistic Regression combined with Image Processing for Near-Pixel Prediction\r\nIn this I used a Logistic Regression (rounded at the end of computation) along with pre-computational image procession to predict what parts of the images fit the training data. In this specific example I used this to train the algorithm to predict what parts of an image are grass and which are not. To do this I gave it training data (pictures of grass and pictures of things without grass and labeled them respectively) and the algorithm then came up with parameters which allowed me to determine what part of an image (any image -- training data or not) has grass. For example I inputed the following images:\r\n![image a](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OuXXzSv-wJUQ9OKgzRl-U8bW6GSxi2j0lskMUjyXBvH9HFka-D8huM4FDyppBJVAJafUJzE=s170)\r\n![image b](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pJdSKhVFI4czjYZ-uykJc6xEljJ7xm-BUjgkGIf6Bj0BDhINAf9Ga8jzsQBMQ3M8PJVtTQ=s170)\r\n![image c](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qJUu_OLAVq0cFIDRAt8ljIqGwXdXbgmLd6fzfjxDMersPI7BCll060nml-7VXb4uPJW1eg=s148)\r\n![image d](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LKj3Suy6Ol0SlU9tSx_vC6eJtwLE27uCB7kOvoF9mv_eT5qZCJ1jD86BSXgU83oKwJ-z=s170)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors",
