<p>This is page is a demo of some of the applications of machine learning code I've written. Below each section is a demonstration of individual cases of each.</p>

<h3><a id="logistic-regression-combined-with-image-processing-for-near-pixel-prediction" class="anchor" href="#logistic-regression-combined-with-image-processing-for-near-pixel-prediction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Logistic Regression combined with Image Processing for Near-Pixel Prediction </h3>

<p>In this I used a Logistic Regression (rounded at the end of computation) along with pre-computational image procession to predict what parts of the images fit the training data. In this specific example I used this to train the algorithm to predict what parts of an image are grass and which are not. To do this I gave it training data (pictures of grass and pictures of things without grass and labeled them respectively) and the algorithm then came up with parameters which allowed me to determine what part of an image (any image -- training data or not) has grass. For example, after I inputed the following images:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/1ca6da2109.jpg" alt="Image a", style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/1ca6e234fb.jpg" alt="Image b" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/1ca6eb5f9a.jpg" alt="Image c" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/1ca6f1a2dc.jpg" alt="Image d" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>

<p>The algorithm outputed these images:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/1c9906befa.jpg" alt="Image a" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/1c990db67a.jpg" alt="Image b" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/1c99160f30.jpg" alt="Image c" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
<img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/1c9922c3cc.jpg" alt="Image d" style="width:200px;height:200px;"></p>

<p>*Note that white corresponds to grass and black corresponds the opposite and the previous eight images are scaled.</p>

<p>As you can see this algorithm is not perfect but shows a rough approximation and it can easily be imagined in autonomous lawnmowers (because the image input would be a smaller image of mostly grass and only dirt or flowers would be the items it would have to filter) or for estimating acreage of grass on land, etc.</p>
      
<p> Below is an webapp I wrote that allows you to upload your own file and the algorithm will output what pixels it "thinks" is grass using the previous black and white to indicate it. Note: if you put an image that is mainly grass the image will be mostly white so it might be hard to see. Also only png and jpg files are accepted if the file is jpeg or anyother extension please change it to jpg or png.</p>

    <p> In this I used a artificial neural network algorithm (trained via back-propigation) to classify an image as being in a city or rural setting. To do this I also wrote a neural network configuration file reader which takes a json file with a specific format and data to allow even greater generality (i.e. it can be used for any other situation requiring an artifical neural network) </p>
    <p> Like before I have written a webapp that allows you to upload a file and the algorithm will output whether it "thinks" the image is in a rural or city setting along with the probrability thereof. </p>
